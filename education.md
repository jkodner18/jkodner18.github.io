As of 2025, I've been exploring the question of what insights from theoretical linguistics can be applied in pre-university classrooms, to strengthen language pedagogy — a line of work that is relatively underexplored in both linguistics and education spaces. Below are some output of mine in pursuing this line of work.
<ul>
 <li>An <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SO8hN3rNEPL7aJ77xHhtBwaUNfxquW5J/view?usp=sharing">informational guide</a> for teachers that introduces ideas for bringing linguistics into the classroom, along with justifications thereof.</li>
 <li>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n89c2lWBXurFI8sFrZLGKluargDcVqds5XOlU25Y5z8/edit?usp=drive_link">lesson on the linguistics of word-level stress</a>, delivered to a 7th-grade English class to supplement instruction on poetry. Special thanks to Beth Keyser for this opportunity.
</li>
 <li>A set of introductory linguistics crashcourse materials, taught to high school students at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MEuvq0Itn0YTuoVcWvOu1Uw7jkXBNtdk_IsPYC5ogyc/edit?usp=drive_link">MIT Splash 2025</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gn_4Kod_57-sjvaWnCwkUk4NSlypf9IkiyaveM-aTs8/edit?usp=sharing">Harvard HWeek 2025, with the latter having a Mandarin-English bilingual component.</a></li>
</ul><br>

<p>The above is from an English lesson I taught in 2025 at Shinkaie Elementary School (新開國小) in Miaoli, Taiwan. In this lesson, I superimposed a pitch contour (visualization of change in one's pitch) above sentences in question-answer pairs, and had students practice these together as dialogues, to build students' understanding of English intonation. See <a href="https://youtu.be/F6M11zjLJb8">here</a> for related local news coverage of my volunteering in rural Taiwan.</p>
